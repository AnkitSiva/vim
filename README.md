# Ankit's Vim Profile
Quick shout-out to Nathaniel Ringo who goes to the U of M and helped me get on my feet with Vim!

To get started with my Vim profile, you should probably remove your current Vim profile by running:
`rm ~/.vim/vimrc`
Next, open Vim and run `:PlugInstall`

Voila! You're ready to go

### Notes
* You will need to install or patch your own [NerdFont] (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for the dev-icons to show up properly
* I use the plug-in manager [Vim-Plug] (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
